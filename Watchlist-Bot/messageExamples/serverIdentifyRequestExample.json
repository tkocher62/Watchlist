//When the SCP server plugin tries to connect to the TCP socket on the bot, it must identify itself within 5000ms, else it will be timed out.
//This is the IDENT message that the discord bot is looking for once a connection is established. It should contain the server ID that matches the ID in your config file.
{
	"type": "IDENT",
	"data": "7778", //data should be the same thing as the "id" tag in the config file for a server entry
	"maxUsers" : 32 //optional but would be a good idea to provide
}

//Once you send this IDENT, the server will send either response below:
{
	"type": "IDENT",
	"data": "PASS"
}

//Failure below. On failure the connection is terminated.
{
	"type": "IDENT",
	"data": "FAIL"
}

//Note that only one socket can be registered for a server at a time!
